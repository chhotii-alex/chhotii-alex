- 👋 Hi, I’m @chhotii-alex
- 👀 I’m interested in many things! I worry about environmental disasters: climate disruption, plastic in the ocean, deforestation, loss of biodiversity. I also 
worry about fascism and voter suppression. The world is a worrisome place. When I'm not worring about things, I'm interested in evolutionary biology, how the brain works, languages,
dream interpretation, linear algebra, and graph theory. I'm into Star Trek and Doctor Who.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PostGIS, php, Swift, and Flyway.
- 💞️ When I have some free time (LOL), I’ll be looking to collaborate on JavaScript frameworks for putting psychology testing tasks on-line, and/or interfaces 
scheduling software and publications for fan-run science fiction conventions.
